# Intro to Reason Compilation

[Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/) is a syntax and tooling ecosystem for OCaml. The OCaml's compilation and build system can get rather sophisticated; This repository serves as a tutorial that explains some of the intricacies. It's always nice to know what really happens under the hood!

**Note** that this is for the curious people. You don't need to know these things immediately when you start consuming Reason and the rest. If you just want to try Reason, [this](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/javascript) is the right place to start instead.

We start with the most basic OCaml compiler commands and gradually build up to a productive workflow. Each step resides in its independent, fully functional folder.

If you feel certain steps aren't clear, or if you'd like to request a new step, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request! P.S. we're on IRC freenode #reasonml and [Discord reasonml](https://discord.gg/reasonml).

## Requirement

Have Reason >=1.13.5 installed. See [this help page](https://reasonml.github.io/guide/editor-setup)
